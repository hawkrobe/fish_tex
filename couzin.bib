But no one has systematically examined whether a similar kind of {\textquotedblleft}collective intelligence{\textquotedblright} exists for groups of people. In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group{\textquoteright}s performance on a wide variety of tasks. This {\textquotedblleft}c factor{\textquotedblright} is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.},
